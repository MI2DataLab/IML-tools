Load [`titanic_imputed`](https://modeloriented.github.io/DALEX/reference/titanic.html) data set.

```{r}
data(titanic_imputed, package = "DALEX")

head(titanic_imputed)
```


```{r}
library(iml)
library(randomForest)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(123)
```

Fit a random forest to the titanic imputed data.

```{r}
rf_model <- randomForest(survived~., data = titanic_imputed)
```

```{r}
X <- titanic_imputed[which(names(titanic_imputed) != "survived")]
```
